# Brand-Sitter
An app that uses machine learning to classify the average connotation of the most recent 100 tweets for a specific hashtag or Twitter username

Features: The view was designed using Autolayout and UIKit. I used Cocoapods to install SwifteriOS, which was used to simplify RESTful services when working with the Twitter API. SwiftyJSON was used to simplify parsing the results of the API call. I used CreateML to create a machine that used a text classifier to decide if a tweet was positive, negative, or neutral. I used CoreML to incorporate the .mlmodel into the project.
